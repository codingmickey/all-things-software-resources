# Software Engineering Books to read

+ some resources that I try to follow to improve my software engineering skills

## Books

- [The Software Engineer Guidebook](./books/The-Software-Engineer-Guidebook.pdf) by Gergely Orosz

> I'm not sure if you know about Gergely Orosz and his newsletter (The Pragmatic Engineer), but this is a book written by him. I think it's a good read, especially at the beginning of your career. Make sure to read at least Part I and II!

> The "Getting things done" of Part II is especially important
